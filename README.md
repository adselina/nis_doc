Documentation is an essential part of making any open source project useful to users. But it's not always developers' top priority, as they may be more focused on making their application better than on helping people use it. This is why making it easier to publish documentation is so valuable to developers. In this tutorial, I'll show you one option for doing so: combining the [Docsify]() documentation generator with [GitHub Pages]().

Download the sample content from GitHub
I have published this example source code on the [project GitHub page](). You can download the files individually or clone the repo with:

`git clone https://github.com/bryantson/OpensourceDotComDemos`

Then cd into the DocsifyDemo directory.
